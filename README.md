# Graph QL Demo Project
This is a project part of the Post-Degree Diploma on Web and Mobile Development program of Langara College. In this project, I had to create a full-stack application that uses React, GraphQL, Apollo Client, and Express.

It uses a schema file with a hard-coded lists of people and cars. The app's purpose is to keep track of these people and cars, displaying them, and allowing them to be created, edited, updated, and deleted. (CRUD for both people and cars). Each person can have 0 to multiple cars, and each car must belong to one and only one person
